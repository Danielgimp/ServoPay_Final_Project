### Project goals – Our idea comes to solve a problem where small business owners or a 
private person have an issue giving their services to small audiences in close by 
proximity, and our solution comes to solve that issue, via mobile infrastructure.
Every business has it's own promotional profile and everyone has an option to log into 
the service and view the business profiles. This would be done with a search by 
category, price, location, etc, which in return would let consumers to find the desirable 
product they seek for with ease.
Another goal would be the app design with two goal in mind:
Catch the user's attention.
Make the app easy to use and inviting.
Other goal would be for the service giver – provide him a dedicated platform for the 
matter.

### Project scope – The project includes a mobile app featuring our clients which are 
advertising their services, option to make an appointment, and contact details, to reach 
the service giver, as well as a swiping interface.
The project in it's roots do not offer to advertise big corporations, or for big audiences, 
the goal here is to help service givers and give them a costumer boost.
The app also do not offer instant connection to the service giver, but includes contact 
information upon choice from the business owner.
